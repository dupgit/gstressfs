This project will provide a base to write tests. The aim is to stress a
filesystem. As there is many type of filesystem and that some of them are
also networked (meaning that all computing is not only done by the machine
where the program runs) there is no special data retrieved (say some cpu
utilisation, I/O bandwidth and so on). This should be done with other tools
such as munin, nagios, and so on... .

Every one is encouraged to write a test for a specific case.

When creating a new test please note the following : 
 - Add new files (my_test.c and include/my_test.h) to src/Makefile.am
 - Include my_test.h in gstressfs.h (at the end)
 - All tests should be considered as atomic (the test framework does so)
   but you can write non atomic tests, it only means that they'll run
   much more times (see creation_file as an example)
 - Keep in mind that your atomic test will be threaded, so do not write
   in your private datas (as there is no mutex capabilities and no
   memory copy, you may experiment funny things coarse to debug !).
