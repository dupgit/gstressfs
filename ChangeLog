	   * Modified the calls to the libduptools to
	     refer the new 0.0.4 API

06.03.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added tests to avoid seg fault when the filesystem
	     hangs out (unable to create a new directory)
	     Added a new test in file_creation that creates one file
	     of a defined size (from 4k to 1M)
	
05.03.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added a new menu function that group functions together
	   * Added varying function list that collects functions that
	     may help to vary some parameters. Thoses functions works
	     with run_one_test_many_threaded_increasing function.
	   * In file_creation.c, for increased performances moved a 
	     g_malloc and g_free couple out of the test function in 
	     order that it only runs one time instead of hundreds of 
	     thousand ! If we want some buffer varying function we may
	     add this couple to the varying function itself !
	   * Passed file_size type from guint to guint64.
	   * rusage statistics collection (Still a lot of work to do
	     with threads and for printing them out !)

	   * Simplified the exec directory name handling
	   * All tests are running in their own sub-directories
	   * Changed the initialisation for the tests in order
	     that each initialisation can initiate more than on test
	   * Clarified a bit README file in order that people understand
	     howto make new tests
	   * Changed #define name to be more clear and less confusing
	
21.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added a percent gfloat in test_t structure to reflect the 
	     percentage realised of the test running (until it gets an 
	     error).
	   * More thread safe
	   * Added test menus and submenus (one test, many tests) still to
	     code threaded tests, all tests and more ?
	
20.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Now depends on libduptools and no more on liblats
	
19.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added private data to the file_creation test (as an example)
	
18.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added a timer to know the execution time
	   * Added a threaded test system
	
08.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added one basic test (file_creation)
	   * Added basic testing features (multiples times, incrementation)
	
07.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Added first glade interface
	
06.02.2008 Olivier Delhomme <olivierdelhomme@gmail.com>
	   * Project creation & skeletton
	     - depends on liblats and libglade
